I designed this project after spending a few hours working on it; I don't know exactly how much time I spent on it. But it takes at least 2 to 3 hours. The 3D design was not made by me because my 3D designing sucks. I found it online. I was about to upload my project and was scrolling to find the needed component, and found a stepper motor, and an idea struck in my mind to use that in place of the two servo motors. I tried to sketch it on Wokwi, but it was too difficult, mainly due to the absence of an external power supply. But any ways I am sharing my previous design as proof. https://wokwi.com/projects/438652373013055489
