# Robotics-Crane-System
This joystick-controlled crane arm uses two servos for smooth 360° base rotation, one servo for vertical arm movement, and a gripper servo for grabbing and releasing objects. The joystick’s X-axis rotates the base, the Y-axis lifts or lowers the arm, and the button toggles the gripper between open and closed states.
